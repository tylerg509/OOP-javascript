sayHello()

//two ways to define functions
//function declaration
function sayHello(){}

//function expression
const sayGoodbye = function(){}

//function declaration are hoisted. meaning they are placed at the top of the code 
//this allow us to call the function in the js file before it is defined == see sayHello ex.

//function expressions are not hoisted == you must define before you call

//classes can be a function or expression
