let myArray = [];

//look at prototype of my array
//myarray inherits from array base
//array base has a secires of methods on it such as map foreach etc
//array base inherits from objectbase (root object) which you can see in the prototype of arraybase
console.log(myArray)

//objects created by a given constructor will have the same prototype
