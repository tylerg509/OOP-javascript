let x = {} same as let x = new Object()

we use literals instead of constructor String() = ''
new Boolean() = true,false

1) every object has constructor property which references function used to create the object

2) in javascript everything is an object. A function is an object


value types(primative types) = Number, String, Boolean, Symbol es6, undefined, null
//copied by value = see value-reference-types ex

reference types (objects) = Object, Function, Array. array and function are objects
//copied by reference = see value-reference-types

primatives are copied by their value

objects are copied by their reference
